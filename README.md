# Superviz.io

## 🧠 Project Goal

**Superviz.io** is a universal service manager designed to operate as `PID 1` inside containers or as a complement to `systemd` on traditional hosts. It centralizes provisioning, service launching, observability and logging – whether in Docker, VMs, bare-metal or cloud-init environments.

### Key Features

* Acts as an **init system** (`PID 1`) inside containers or as a complement to **systemd** on traditional systems
* Handles **post-provisioning**: auto-installs required binaries (Vault, Consul, etc.)
* Supports **pre-runtime build** for Docker layer caching
* Launches services with configuration, environment and dependencies
* Monitors services and performs automatic restarts if needed
* Manages **environment variables** with schema validation and conditional injection
* Verifies integrity of critical files via **hashes** (SHA-256, etc.)
* Exposes **OpenTelemetry metrics** (service state, errors, resource usage)
* Handles **log management** with rotation, max size and auto-cleanup
* Planned: **hot-reload** through configuration diffing and targeted service restarts
* Advanced health model with **granular service status tracking**
* Optional agent installation via **SSH** when credentials/key are provided

## 🚠 Typical Use Cases

* Docker container with a smart, self-sufficient **entrypoint**
* Infrastructure provisioning using **cloud-init**, Terraform or Ansible
* Lightweight distributions or systems without `systemd`
* Optimised Docker image builds using pre-compiled binaries
* Replacement for legacy init systems like `supervisord`, `runit` or `s6`

## 📦 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/superviz https://superviz.io/download/latest/superviz-linux-amd64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/superviz
```

## 💼 Enterprise Edition & Trial

Enterprise features (HA clustering, RBAC, audit UI, etc.) are available in an **EE build**.
A 30-day evaluation binary is published on the [releases page](https://github.com/kodflow/superviz.io/releases).
Activate it with an evaluation key or run without `LICENSE_KEY` for a limited trial.

> Production use of EE requires a commercial licence issued by Making Codes.

## 📈 Observability

Superviz.io exposes metrics via **OpenTelemetry**:

* **Pull mode** - Prometheus-compatible `/metrics`
* **Push mode** - OTLP exporter (HTTP/gRPC)

Configurable in `superviz.yaml`.

Example metrics: CPU/RAM per service • uptime • crash loops.

### Health-check Status Model

| Status       | Meaning                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `starting`   | Process launched, not yet verified (`gracePeriod`) |
| `running`    | Process active at OS level                         |
| `ready`      | App live and able to serve traffic                 |
| `degraded`   | Running but partially failing (latency, 5xx, …)    |
| `unhealthy`  | Health-checks failed, process still alive          |
| `crashed`    | Process exited unexpectedly                        |
| `restarting` | Auto-restart in progress                           |
| `stopped`    | Stopped voluntarily                                |
| `dead`       | Cannot be started / permanently failed             |

Combine multiple checks (TCP, HTTP, command) in `superviz.yaml`.

## 📝 Logs

Structured logs with:

* Rotation (size/date)
* Max files retention
* Optional compression

OTel-Logs export planned.

## ❌ What Superviz.io **is not**

* A container runtime (`containerd`, Docker)
* An orchestrator (no scheduler/clustering)
* A remote log collector (use Promtail, Fluent-bit, …)
* A sandbox manager (`chroot`, `jail` unsupported)
